# Psychic-Game
In this game, you are going to guess the lettere. The computer will randomly pick a letter from an array of lowercase letters, and you have to guess which letter the program chose. 

If you guessed correctly, you win!
If you didn't guess correctly, the number of guesses reduces by 1.
If you run out of guesses, you lose the game and the game is over.
